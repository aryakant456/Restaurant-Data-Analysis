# 🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis and Rating Prediction

This project involves end-to-end analysis of a global restaurant dataset. It explores customer preferences, service features (like online delivery and table booking), pricing, and cuisine trends across cities and countries. Using data visualization and machine learning, the project aims to uncover insights that can help restaurants and food platforms make informed decisions.

## 📌 Highlights

- Mapped country codes to real names for better interpretation  
- Identified top cities and cuisines by restaurant count and rating  
- Visualized how booking and delivery affect customer ratings  
- Built multiple models to predict restaurant ratings using engineered features  
- Displayed trends in votes, costs, and price ranges using interactive charts

---

## ✅ Sample Insights

- Restaurants offering **table booking** tend to have slightly higher ratings  
- **Filipino** and **Japanese** cuisines were most popular in terms of votes and ratings  
- The **price range 3** was the most common among all restaurants  
- **Random Forest Regressor** gave the best performance in predicting ratings
